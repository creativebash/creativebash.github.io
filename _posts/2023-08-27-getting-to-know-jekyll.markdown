# Introduction to Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator that allows you to create websites and blogs using plain text files. It's a powerful tool for developers, bloggers, and content creators who want to focus on writing content rather than dealing with complex content management systems.

## Why Choose Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several benefits for building websites:

- **Simplicity:** You write content in Markdown, which is easy to learn and use.
- **Speed:** Static sites load quickly, providing a better user experience.
- **Security:** Since there's no database or server-side scripting, security risks are reduced.
- **Version Control:** Websites built with Jekyll can be versioned using Git, making collaboration and maintenance a breeze.

# Getting Started

To start using Jekyll, follow these steps:

1. Install Jekyll by running `gem install jekyll bundler` in your terminal.
2. Create a new Jekyll site using `jekyll new my-blog`.
3. Navigate to your site's directory with `cd my-blog`.
4. Customize the `_config.yml` file to set your site's title, description, and other settings.

You can easily add images to your Jekyll posts:
