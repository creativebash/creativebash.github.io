About tonkeeper battery
ðŸ”‹Tonkeeper Battery

We are excited to announce a major new feature: Tonkeeper Battery. It is in public beta and available on all mobile platforms starting today.

Tonkeeper Battery removes an obstacle for newcomers: you can get a stablecoin or an NFT and use them right away without acquiring native coins to pay for gas. You wonâ€™t need to go to an exchange, pass KYC checks, enter a lot of details only to buy a random amount of coins you did not think you needed.

With Tonkeeper Battery you will never have to worry about gas anymore. Top up your battery with a banking card or a stablecoin, and use all features of your wallet right away.

How does it work?

With Tonkeeper Battery you can receive tokens (stablecoins, NFTs etc.) and make payments with a token â€” without going to an exchange to buy coins to cover blockchain fees. Tonkeeper Battery pays your fees for you, automatically.

You can charge the battery with one tap using in-app purchases, or with TON or stablecoins. Send a few dollars worth of stablecoins or TON to a special address: battery.ton and it will automatically apply charges to your account.

Tonkeeper Battery is denominated in charges, each charge covers the fee of a simple TON transfer transaction. More complex transactions may consume 5, 10 or more charges.
